	--- An essay on seniority and tech recruitment ---
			
	As I am now starting to get into the corporate life, I&#39;ve been more keen to	
	observe how developing relationships with people, specially those who have more	
	company time, can help someone grow professionally. An example of such shows	
	itself when you&#39;re maintaining huge systems developed internally, which, for	
	me in particular, is what I spend most of my working hours on. To have someone	
	you can rely on when the internet/documentation aren&#39;t quite enough is very	
	reassuring, and it seems that, no matter how much I learn while in an industry	
	context or by looking with an outsider&#39;s perspective, that knowledge seems	
	negligible (when solving my problems) when compared to what I learn from my more	
	experienced peers and when while I accumulate experience while solving internal	
	issues.		
			
	What I mean by that is, in my head, is easy to split the technical knowledge	
	(and I&#39;m only talking about actual hard skills here) into two very different	
	categories. The first being things that can be learned from the outside:	
	programming languages, libraries/frameworks, design patterns, system/software	
	architecture and the like. These are very valuable skills to have in your tool	
	belt and IMHO they make you a very valuable asset to any corporation. The	
	second, in contrast, is knowing how the business and its cogs operate. Moreover,	
	my goal today is to explore how my mentality shifted regarding the importance of	
	the latter and how it can be explored to improve the tech market.		
			
	&lt;Intermission&gt;		
	Before getting into that. I would like to rant about LinkedIn/Instagram for a	
	brief moment. That was my motivation for writing this post BTW. If that&#39;s	
	not relevant to you, just `ctrl + f + &lt;/` out of the intermission tag, or	
	something.		
			
	Social media memes about work: 90% are just garbage. Bump that up like +5% when	
	adding AI slop to the mix. They are not funny, people who find them funny should	
	probably broaden their entertainment routine to doom scrolling, brain rot or	
	something. I&#39;m sure the dopamine you get from those will be more enjoyable	
	than spending more than an hour scrolling through your LinkedIn feed nowadays.		
			
	But, somehow, the Brazilian developer meme community can be even duller. Senior	
	v.s Junior dev, complaining about PMs POs Jira, front-end not being programming	
	and hating on Java/php. These same jokes, just like a broken record...	
	That&#39;s all they talk about. When relevant things actually do happen, like	
	the recent Firefox AI browser thing	
	(<a href="https://infosec.press/brunomiguel/is-mozilla-trying-hard-to-kill-itself">https://infosec.press/brunomiguel/is-mozilla-trying-hard-to-kill-itself</a>), that	
	part of the internet just doesn&#39;t seem to care... At all.		
			
	I truly believe in this community&#39;s potential, but people just limit	
	themselves to what&#39;s required from them by the corporations they work at,	
	the famous &quot;fazedor de CRUD&quot; is all they strive for. And a symptom of	
	that is not being able to poke fun at any of the recent mishaps, because those	
	actually require minimal technical knowledge on the matter. Comedy is a weapon	
	for critique, after all...		
			
	I&#39;m not saying that good developers are lacking in my home country, I&#39;m	
	trying to convey that with the increasing interest shown by the locals, people	
	should be more aware of the tech world that surrounds them. Building a community	
	that gets past superficial knowledge (i.e A Brazilian version of	
	<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">https://news.ycombinator.com</a>) would be way more delightful to engage in,	
	wouldn&#39;t it? But I digress.		
	&lt;/Intermission&gt;		
			
	Getting back on topic. I&#39;d like to unpack the concept of seniority and as to	
	why I don&#39;t fully agree with what people usually esteem from the term.	
	Recall the two categories we discussed earlier, let&#39;s give them names to	
	make them easier to reference: I&#39;ll call them _external_ and _internal_	
	knowledge from now on. Usually, when people think of senior programmers, they	
	are thinking about external knowledge, with it&#39;s meaning&#39;s depth varying	
	across different contexts. The title of &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot;,	
	for instance, does not take into account what the individual is actually	
	proficient in, and what people do to fix that is putting a language/field as a	
	prefix: &quot;Senior Java Developer&quot;, &quot;Sr. SRE&quot;. Again, I&#39;m	
	not disregarding the effort people put into learning about the topic that	
	interests them, 10h C++ crash courses on free code academy, 100h+ on LeetCode	
	exercises... I&#39;m not saying those hold no value. However, I think these pale	
	in comparison, in an employee&#39;s value to the company standpoint, to the	
	internal knowledge mentioned.		
			
	Imagine you just got into a new company as a Sr. dev, completely different from	
	the line of work from your previous job, but the tech stack is the same, at	
	least. I assure you that the cognitive effort of actually understanding this	
	different line of business will be much expressive then thinking about the nooks	
	and crannies of this new software you are creating. You will come up with a	
	bunch of sophisticated ideas on how you can implement an event oriented	
	microsservice, blazzing fast Rust application, but 90% your time will be spent	
	talking to people on the business logic that should be implemented. Over	
	engineering can be the cause for loss in efficiency, time, cash and your career	
	at the company.		
			
	&quot;Oh, so it&#39;s impossible to be a senior in a company without spending	
	10+ years in it then? Are you saying knowledge is not transferable between	
	jobs?&quot;. Yes and No, hear me out. I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say	
	it again: Learning is always good, there is not downside to it. But	
	unfortunately, the economy today does not require specialists, what makes money	
	flow is getting work done. Saying this does frustrate me - Thinking about the	
	solution is way more fun than actually solving the problem - but, according to	
	my short but valuable experience up until now, that is how I interpret the	
	current scenario. Companies don&#39;t care about how many programming languages	
	you know, they don&#39;t care about how deeply you know about Haskell and their	
	monads, they just want you to do this 100 line python script that processes data	
	in a specific way and sends it to another service, this is what makes the cogs	
	their system turn and what pays your hardly earned salary at the end of the day.	
	So you **should** learn your tools, but invest more time into learning about	
	their processes and how make them more efficient, specially in an automation	
	standpoint.		
			
	And now, we dive head first onto the second topic at hand. Tech recruitment	
	nowadays has a lot to improve. Big companies are delegating talent scouting to	
	HR, and that&#39;s making the workforce quality decrease exponentially. Team	
	leaders/people in the actual projects should be the ones prospecting new talent;	
	HR&#39;s daily work is typically disconnected to ongoing projects affairs, they	
	lack awareness on the internal knowledge discussed, so it&#39;s very unlikely	
	that they can make good decisions on that front. The project&#39;s leadership	
	and those who get their hands dirty, on the other hand, know their system, they	
	know which puzzle pieces are missing, so they should be ones making these kinds	
	of decisions.		
			
	I do not agree that personality tests, gamified hiring processes or horoscope	
	matching will do any good to weed out the bad apples, nor do I endorse focusing	
	the entirety of the process into knowing if the candidate can implement tree	
	inversion blindfolded, or if they know the difference between FIFO and a	
	multilevel feedback queue, that&#39;s not what makes a senior in my sense of the	
	word. What should be prioritized is knowing whether the candidate is apt to	
	perform their upcoming tasks, that being, if they have what it takes to handle	
	what&#39;s to come. And their ability and interest to learn what makes the clock	
	tick inside the office&#39;s doors is a pretty good indicator for that, IMO.		
			
	For small companies, adding one more duty to the technical lead seems doable.	
	For big ones, though, things get a bit more challenging due to the sheer volume	
	of people trying to get in. Knowing that and dedicating the scarce workforce	
	into looking at hundreds of thousands of applications would be counterproductive	
	and a bad decision altogether. So how should they hire? My answer to that is a	
	kind of a hot take, but I think people who are looking to work at a company are	
	the ones who should sell themselves better. Technical people can sniff out	
	bullshit and they know who&#39;s the real deal. So making yourself be heard by	
	showing off cools personal projects, that actually prove your ability and	
	dedication to make things happen, writing interesting blogs posts, studying	
	about their prospected companies tech stacks, participating on tech events and	
	career fairs, etc. should be what these people should start investing their time	
	in. Naturally and eventually, interested people in the field are bound to notice	
	and reach out. That way, I think team building will be easier and the quality of	
	work will have a much larger chance to improve.		
			
	I look forward to see what the future of the tech market holds. So I shall	
	conclude this post, and this year, in a more light hearted manner: here some of	
	my predictions as to what&#39;s to come. Don&#39;t hold me accountable to any	
	consequences if you take my words to heart (you probably shouldn&#39;t) and let	
	me hear what you think if you are interested in reaching out...		
			
	= Vibecoding will dominate for a while. Companies, in search of efficiency, will	
	keep investing in AI, making their software quality worsen. (Really?...)		
	= Software security will eventually boom into one of the most highly paid jobs	
	in the industry.		
	= Rust will become more popular, due to it&#39;s more sophisticated guardrails.		
	= The year of Linux be upon us in the next 2-3 years.		
			
	Happy holidays and I hope to see you in the next one.
